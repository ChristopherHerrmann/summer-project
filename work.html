<h5 class="bg-white text-dark text-center bg-gradient rounded-5"> <br>Over the Summer, I spent alot of time working as a lifeguard, instend of telling you what I did, I would rather tell you some funny stories. Well funny for you, not so much for me. The funniset thing that happened was the day I lost one of my airpods, so I was cleaning the pool and I left one of my airpods near the pool. I come back five minutes later and its gone, figuing someone must have brought it to the lost and found I checked with the other guards, but nothing. So I went home with only one airpod, which sucked but I was sure it would show up eventualy. Fast forward three weeks later and they had found it, at the bottom of the pool. It was a very sad day in the guard group chat. <br><br> </h5>
